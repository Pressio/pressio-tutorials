==================

This section offers severals end-to-end tutorials for pressio.

Our goals are:

- to provide something that can be easily run


Since this is an end-to-end, we show how to run the following steps:
generating the FOM training data, constructing the POD modes,
setting up and running the target ROM problem, and processing the results.

Note that while the SWE are used here, one can easily setup and
run the same workflow for any other problem in pressio-demoapps.

To simplify things and actually make this tutorials useful,
we are going to use the workflow codes inside pressio-demoapps
which enable one to easily setup ROMs for any of those problems.
Using those codes, this complete tutorial can be encoded via the
following yaml file, which will show below how to run.
