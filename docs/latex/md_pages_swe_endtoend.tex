This end-\/to-\/end analysis shows how to use the L\+S\+PG approach to accelerate a forward model of the S\+WE. ~\newline
 In this tutorial, we cover the following steps (each with a dedicated section below)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Use Pressio\textquotesingle{}s time marching schemes to execute solves of the S\+W\+Es to construct training data.
\item Use supporting Python scripts to analyze the training data and construct P\+OD basis vectors.
\item Run the S\+WE F\+OM at a test point in parameter space.
\item Construct and run a standard L\+S\+PG R\+OM for the same test parameter instance.
\item Construct and run a hyper-\/reduced L\+S\+PG R\+OM for same test parameter instance.

After successfully builing the tutorials, set the following env var\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{export SWE2D\_DIR=<where-\/you-\/built-\/pressio-\/tutorials>/tutorials/swe2d}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Step 1\+: Compute F\+O\+M training data}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md20}
For this step, we use the executable obtained from the \href{./md_pages_swe_fom.html}{\texttt{ F\+OM driver}} to evaluate the F\+OM for 9 parameter instances on the grid $\mu_1 \times \mu_3 = [3,6,9]\times [0.05,0.15,0.25]$, over the time interval $t \in (0,10)$ and save the solutions to file.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/offline\_phase}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_fom -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 3. 6. 9. -\/-\/forcing 0.05 0.15 0.25}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will take some time to run, depending on your system. If successful, a series of {\ttfamily solution\#.bin} files should be written. These solution files contain the F\+OM solutions at every time step for each of the nine training parameter instances. To view the results of one sample simulation, we can do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/offline\_phase}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 viewSolutionAndMakePlots.py}
\end{DoxyCode}


This script will bring up a live animation of the solution for the first parameter instance.\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysection{Step 2\+: Compute the bases and build the sample mesh}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md21}
We now need to construct the basis vectors used in the R\+OM. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/offline\_phase}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 makeBasisAndHyperReducedBasis.py}
\end{DoxyCode}


This script loads in the snapshots generated in Step 1. and performs P\+OD to obtain the R\+OM basis. Additionally, this script selects cells for the sample mesh employed in hyper-\/reduction, and saves the relevant information of this sample mesh to file. Specifically, it generates the following files\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily basis.\+txt} This file contains the basis vectors for the R\+OM on the global mesh
\item {\ttfamily sample\+\_\+mesh\+\_\+gids.\+txt} This file contains the global I\+Ds of the indices used for the sample mesh
\item {\ttfamily sample\+\_\+mesh\+\_\+plus\+\_\+stencil\+\_\+gids.\+txt} This file contains the global I\+Ds of the indices used for the sample {\itshape and} stencil mesh
\item {\ttfamily Phi\+Sample\+Plus\+Stencil.\+txt} This file contains the R\+OM basis, but only at the sample mesh plus stencil mesh. Additionally, this script will create a file ($\ast$samplemesh.png) depicting the sample and stencil mesh which we show below. Cells in bright green are the sample mesh, while purple cells are on the stencil mesh.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysection{Step 3\+: Run F\+O\+M at test point}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md22}
We run the F\+OM at a new parameter instance (the user is encouraged to play around with different parameters and see how it impacts the results)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/online\_phase/fom}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_fom -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 7.5 -\/p 0.125 -\/-\/forcing 0.2}
\end{DoxyCode}




\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Approximate F\+OM runtime (with data collection disabled)\+:}
Running the F\+OM on a 2.\+4 G\+Hz 8-\/Core Intel Core i9 using a single thread takes about20 seconds.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{Step 4\+: R\+U\+N a standard L\+S\+P\+G R\+OM}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md23}
To run a standard L\+S\+PG R\+OM, we use the executable obtained from the \href{./md_pages_swe_lspg.html}{\texttt{ L\+S\+PG driver}} In summary, this code couples the application to Pressio, loads in the basis information we generated in the offline phase, and couples to Pressio\textquotesingle{}s R\+OM capabilities to run an L\+S\+PG R\+OM. To run the L\+S\+PG R\+OM, we can do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/online\_phase/lspg\_rom}
\DoxyCodeLine{cp ../../offline\_phase/basis.txt .}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_lspg -\/k 10 -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 7.5 -\/p 0.125 -\/f 0.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 viewSolutionAndMakePlots.py}
\end{DoxyCode}


Notet that we pass $-k = 10$ to use 10 P\+OD modes for each D\+OF as basis to run the R\+OM. This process saves the generalized coordinates of the R\+OM to the {\ttfamily solution.\+bin} file, and {\ttfamily view\+Solution\+And\+Make\+Plots.\+py} plots the height of the water surface for a given spatial location as a function of time, and saves the plot to {\itshape result.\+png}. This plot looks as follows\+:

\end{DoxyParagraph}
We immediately note that our {\itshape R\+OM is slower than the F\+O\+M!} This is due to the well-\/known bottleneck associated with nonlinear systems. To gain computational speedups, we need hyper-\/reduction, as shown below.\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{Step 4\+: R\+U\+N the hyper-\/reduced L\+S\+P\+G R\+OM}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md24}
To run a hypre-\/reduced L\+S\+PG R\+OM, we use the executable obtained from the \href{./md_pages_swe_hrlspg.html}{\texttt{ hyper-\/reduced L\+S\+PG driver}} In summary, this executable loads the basis on the {\itshape stencil mesh}, loads in information about the {\itshape sample mesh} and {\itshape stencil mesh}, and then constructs and runs an L\+S\+PG R\+OM employing the collocation hyper-\/reduction technique.

To run the L\+S\+PG R\+OM with hyper-\/reduction, we can do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/online\_phase/lspg\_hyperReducedRom}
\DoxyCodeLine{cp ../../offline\_phase/*.txt .}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_lspg\_with\_hyperreduction -\/k 10 -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 7.5 -\/p 0.125 -\/f 0.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 viewSolutionAndMakePlots.py}
\end{DoxyCode}


If successful, the following plot will be generated.
