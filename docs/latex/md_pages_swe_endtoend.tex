This end-\/to-\/end analysis shows how to use the LSPG approach to accelerate a forward model of the SWE. ~\newline
 In this tutorial, we cover the following steps (each with a dedicated section below)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Use Pressio\textquotesingle{}s time marching schemes to execute solves of the SWEs to construct training data.
\item Use supporting Python scripts to analyze the training data and construct POD basis vectors.
\item Run the SWE FOM at a test point in parameter space.
\item Construct and run a standard LSPG ROM for the same test parameter instance.
\item Construct and run a hyper-\/reduced LSPG ROM for same test parameter instance.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

After successfully builing the tutorials, set the following env var\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysection{Step 1\+: Compute FOM training data}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md34}
For this step, we use the executable obtained from the \href{./md_pages_swe_fom.html}{\texttt{ FOM driver}} to evaluate the FOM for 9 parameter instances on the grid $\mu_1 \times \mu_3 = [3,6,9]\times [0.05,0.15,0.25]$, over the time interval $t \in (0,10)$ and save the solutions to file.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/offline\_phase}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_fom -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 3. 6. 9. -\/-\/forcing 0.05 0.15 0.25}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This will take some time to run, depending on your system. If successful, a series of {\ttfamily solution\#.bin} files should be written. These solution files contain the FOM solutions at every time step for each of the nine training parameter instances. To view the results of one sample simulation, we can do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/offline\_phase}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 viewSolutionAndMakePlots.py}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This script will bring up a live animation of the solution for the first parameter instance.\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysection{Step 2\+: Compute the bases and build the sample mesh}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md35}
We now need to construct the basis vectors used in the ROM. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/offline\_phase}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 makeBasisAndHyperReducedBasis.py}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This script loads in the snapshots generated in Step 1. and performs POD to obtain the ROM basis. Additionally, this script selects cells for the sample mesh employed in hyper-\/reduction, and saves the relevant information of this sample mesh to file. Specifically, it generates the following files\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily basis.\+txt} This file contains the basis vectors for the ROM on the global mesh
\item {\ttfamily sample\+\_\+mesh\+\_\+gids.\+txt} This file contains the global IDs of the indices used for the sample mesh
\item {\ttfamily sample\+\_\+mesh\+\_\+plus\+\_\+stencil\+\_\+gids.\+txt} This file contains the global IDs of the indices used for the sample {\itshape and} stencil mesh
\item {\ttfamily Phi\+Sample\+Plus\+Stencil.\+txt} This file contains the ROM basis, but only at the sample mesh plus stencil mesh. Additionally, this script will create a file ($\ast$samplemesh.png) depicting the sample and stencil mesh which we show below. Cells in bright green are the sample mesh, while purple cells are on the stencil mesh.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysection{Step 3\+: Run FOM at test point}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md36}
We run the FOM at a new parameter instance (the user is encouraged to play around with different parameters and see how it impacts the results)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/online\_phase/fom}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_fom -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 7.5 -\/p 0.125 -\/-\/forcing 0.2}

\end{DoxyCode}




\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Approximate FOM runtime (with data collection disabled)\+:}
Running the FOM on a 2.\+4 GHz 8-\/Core Intel Core i9 using a single thread takes about20 seconds.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysection{Step 4\+: RUN a standard LSPG ROM}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md37}
To run a standard LSPG ROM, we use the executable obtained from the \href{./md_pages_swe_lspg.html}{\texttt{ LSPG driver}} In summary, this code couples the application to Pressio, loads in the basis information we generated in the offline phase, and couples to Pressio\textquotesingle{}s ROM capabilities to run an LSPG ROM. To run the LSPG ROM, we can do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/online\_phase/lspg\_rom}
\DoxyCodeLine{cp ../../offline\_phase/basis.txt .}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_lspg -\/k 10 -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 7.5 -\/p 0.125 -\/f 0.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 viewSolutionAndMakePlots.py}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Notet that we pass $-k = 10$ to use 10 POD modes for each DOF as basis to run the ROM. This process saves the generalized coordinates of the ROM to the {\ttfamily solution.\+bin} file, and {\ttfamily view\+Solution\+And\+Make\+Plots.\+py} plots the height of the water surface for a given spatial location as a function of time, and saves the plot to {\itshape result.\+png}. This plot looks as follows\+:

\end{DoxyParagraph}
We immediately note that our {\itshape ROM is slower than the FOM!} This is due to the well-\/known bottleneck associated with nonlinear systems. To gain computational speedups, we need hyper-\/reduction, as shown below.\hypertarget{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysection{Step 4\+: RUN the hyper-\/reduced LSPG ROM}\label{md_pages_swe_endtoend_autotoc_md38}
To run a hypre-\/reduced LSPG ROM, we use the executable obtained from the \href{./md_pages_swe_hrlspg.html}{\texttt{ hyper-\/reduced LSPG driver}} In summary, this executable loads the basis on the {\itshape stencil mesh}, loads in information about the {\itshape sample mesh} and {\itshape stencil mesh}, and then constructs and runs an LSPG ROM employing the collocation hyper-\/reduction technique.

To run the LSPG ROM with hyper-\/reduction, we can do\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd \$SWE2D\_DIR/online\_phase/lspg\_hyperReducedRom}
\DoxyCodeLine{cp ../../offline\_phase/*.txt .}
\DoxyCodeLine{./run\_lspg\_with\_hyperreduction -\/k 10 -\/N 64 -\/-\/gravity 7.5 -\/p 0.125 -\/f 0.2}
\DoxyCodeLine{python3 viewSolutionAndMakePlots.py}

\end{DoxyCode}
 If successful, the following plot will be generated.
