# Gauss-Newton via Normal Equations with Known Types

@m_class{m-block m-info}

@par
This tutorial demonstrates how to use
the normal-equations-based Gauss-Newton solver from `pressio/solvers_nonlinear`
using data types natively supported in pressio.
Here, we use Eigen data types, but a similar code
can be used for other natively supported types.
