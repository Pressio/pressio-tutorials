# Linear Decoder for Known Types

@m_class{m-block m-info}

@par
This tutorial demonstrates how to create and use a linear decoder object 
for data types natively supported in pressio.
By natively supported, we mean data types that pressio knows how to manipulate
and perform computation on.
Here, we use Eigen data types as an example, but it works similarly 
for other natively supported types.
